      "- Admire Notre Dame Cathedral's medieval Gothic exterior. Stroll through an iconic neighborhood such as the Latin Quarter or Montmartre. See the Mona Lisa and Venus de Milo at the Louvre.\n",
      "- Eiffel Tower ( Tour Eiffel ) - The Number 1 Attraction in Paris. Soaring high above the Paris landscape, the Eiffer Tower symbolizes Paris.\n",
      "- The Eiffel Tower can be seen from many points in the city, but nothing beats the thrill of going up to the observation platforms. A Seine River cruise or a guided bike tour of the city gives you the perfect way to see it.\n",
      "- Guided tours get to access a separate, much faster security line. Choose one of these excellent guided tours and avoid the long wait in lines.\n",
      "- The Latin Quarter was first settled by Romans in the 1st century. Explore the narrow winding side streets filled with old bookstores, tiny bistros, and quirky boutiques. Visit the beautiful old churches filled with artistic treasures.\n",
      "- MusÃ©e d'Orsay contains a magnificent collection of world-famous Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art. Join a guided tour if you want to get a look at the most famous paintings unobstructed by massive crowds.\n",
      "- The Arc de Triomphe is surrounded by a busy traffic rotary. Get a ticket and climb the stairs to the observation deck at the top for 360 degree views of Paris. At the base of the monument, visit the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and eternal flame.\n",
      "- Don't miss the parades and celebrations on Champs Ã‰lysÃ©es that start at the Arc. Pompidou Center's edgy design features exterior walls of brightly colored tubes and exposed mechanical systems.\n",
      "- Luxembourg Garden is Paris' most popular park. The 60 acres are divided into many distinctive areas. You can even play tennis here.\n",
      "- Monet's famous water lily ponds and garden at Giverny are just one of the top attractions you can see on day trips from Paris. You can leave Paris in the morning and spend the day enjoying famous sights in London, sampling delicious wines and food at a chÃ¢teau near Bordeaux.\n",
